    <description>Visual Leak Detector is a free, robust, open-source memory leak detection system for Visual C++.
                  It's pretty easy to use. After installing it, you just need to tell Visual C++ where to find the included header and library file.
                  Then it can be used with any C/C++ project simply by adding the following line to your code:#include vld.h  
                  When you run your program under the Visual Studio debugger, Visual Leak Detector will output a memory leak report at the end of your debugging session.
                  The leak report includes the full call stack showing how any leaked memory blocks were allocated.
                  Double-click on a line in the call stack to jump to that file and line in the editor window. 
                  It's a very effective way to quickly diagnose, and fix, memory leaks in C/C++ applications.
                  The main difference between the  CRT Debug Library and VLD, is that Visual Leak Detector shows  you the complete  callstack used for memory allocation has led to the leak.
